The task is located in the Задание__№8_Вариант_№1.pdf, where you compare your assignment and the option, if everything fits together, you can easily take the finished report. How the analysis was carried out, what was used, is both in the assignment and in the report itself. I can't download the virus itself, but you can check the options and see that this is exactly what you are looking for. I have attached the report in the form of PDF and DOCX so that you can choose what is more convenient for you, do not forget to double-check the information, because we are all human beings and we can make mistakes. Everything is written in Russian, because I study in Russia, if you need English or another language, use a translator or neural networks.
